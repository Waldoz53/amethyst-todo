# Amethyst To Do List

To do list built with React (Typescript) + turned into a lightweight cross platform desktop app with Tauri. Also uses Zustand as context/state storage, and Supabase for online syncing storage.

[Based on an old Vue to do list I made years ago](https://codepen.io/wrawasia/pen/poJjgJd)

## Tauri Plugins used

- Updater
- Process
- Dialog

## Other Modules

- AJV (JSON validation)
- Supabase (PostgresSQL DB)

## Future Plans

- Always ongoing: reorganize code
- Settings page for:
- ...delete remote data
- ...delete user account
- Add an update window that shows the update info AND that shows up only after an update is installed
- Monetization (TBD)
