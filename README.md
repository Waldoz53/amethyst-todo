# Amethyst To Do List
A to do list built with React Typescript + Tauri. Built as a lightweight cross platform app.

## Future Plans
1. Reorganize code
2. Modify due date options
3. Add labels to the inputs instead of placeholders
2. Settings page for:
3. ...modifying auto delete on completion
4. ...login/logout
5. ...delete user data from there as well
6. ...delete user account
7. ...other settings stuff
8. Better UI: move add to bottom of the app for mobile versions?
9. Add a sync to do lists with account sign up, leading into monetization
