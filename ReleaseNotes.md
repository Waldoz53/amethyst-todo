# Beta - v0.2.1

### Home
- Experimental: adjusted size of inputs + todo items. I think it looks better + you can have more todo items visible at once without scrolling.

### Settings
- Added new settings!
- Users can enable an auto delete timer, so after a task is marked as complete, it'll automatically delete itself
- Users can enable a dialog box/alert after a task's timer expires

### Miscellaneous
- Misc. css, js tweaks

### Known Issues
- The task timer expiry alert message might be a little buggy?
